Mirroring website for http://napirajz.hu

The famous Hungarian comic series is filtered out by many corporate proxies,
thus depriving fans of vital inspiration.

To overcome this, the site needs to be mirrored.
This mirroring engine creates 3 main pages:
- index.html  : the last 20 comics
- tegnapi.html: archives grouped my months
- keres.pl    : search in comics by filename

Make sure to call the following scripts regularly from cron:
- napi   : regularly
- tegnapi: end of each month

This site was designed to be small, running on OpenWRT routers as well,
provided Perl is installed. You might need an external HDD for this.
