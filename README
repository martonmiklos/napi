Mirroring website for http://napirajz.hu
Powering http://subogero.dyndns.org/git/napi/

The famous Hungarian comic series is filtered out by many corporate proxies,
thus depriving fans of vital inspiration.

To overcome this, the site needs to be mirrored.
This mirror contains 3 main pages:
- index.html  : the last 20 comics
- tegnapi.html: archives grouped my months
- keres.pl|cgi: search in comics by filename

Call the following scripts regularly from cron to update the site:
- napi   : regularly
- tegnapi: end of each month

This site was designed to be small, running on OpenWRT routers as well.
If perl is installed, keres.pl is used for search,
otherwise it's the keres.cgi shell script.
The latter is bloody slow.
