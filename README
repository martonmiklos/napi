Mirroring website for http://napirajz.hu
Powering http://subogero.dyndns.org/git/napi/

The famous Hungarian comic series is filtered out by many corporate proxies,
thus depriving fans of vital inspiration.

To overcome this, the site needs to be mirrored.
This mirror contains 3 main pages, powered by index.pl:
- napi   : the last 31 days
- tegnapi: archives grouped my months
- keres  : search in comics by filename and source

Call the following scripts regularly from cron to update the site:
- frissit : hourly? 

This site was designed to be small, running on OpenWRT routers as well.
Required packages: perl, curl, wget.
The site uses CGI technology, but not the CGI.pm Perl module.
